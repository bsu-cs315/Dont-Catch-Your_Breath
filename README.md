## Project Report

### Reflection
I'm really happy with my final project. I only used one video (being https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4XeyJI0_Wk) and the rest of the coding came from practice and knowledge learned during the course.
The biggest problem I had was time crunch as always. With a few more hours I could fix up the project layout and allow it to become a much bigger game.
A lot of the coding could also be fixed with more time, but I also wanted to do as much as possible without outside help, leading to the sloppiness.
With that being said I came out with a demo of what I set out to create that feels like a strong proof of concept. My biggest struggle was finding systems that could use live movement and asynchronus qualities.
There wasn't one thing I felt that I excelled on, but I felt myself flying through many topics we've covered compared to past iterations and projects.
This includes tilemaps, animation, player movement, enemy movement, gampeplay loop, tweening, Vector understanding, layout, visual and auditory inclusions, and more.
I learned a lot about tilemaps and using masks and layers to blend the tilemap into other elements such as bigger set pieces or the player's hook. This was also important to make sure certain enemies appeared in front or beihind of specific layers.
Everything I've been working on that was difficult finally came together in a fast proccess. I had a particularly enriching time making a sweeping laser with visual effects, and designing enemy ai.

- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [x] C-4: Either the <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
