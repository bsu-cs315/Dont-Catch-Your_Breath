## Project Report

### Reflection
I finally got the hook figured out and added some more mechanics with it. There are no longer glitches or inconsistencies.
I struggled with particles and raycasting to develop a laser attack for my first enemy. I first tried to copy a similar idea to my grappling hook but didn't find success.
I then decided to try raycasting and setting up the laser fire on a timer. It took a lot of time to figure out how to use the correct tween and raycast methods.
For future iterations I will improve on the lasers design and the gameplay experience from start to finish. Something I found success with this iteration was making an objective to protect from the enemies.
