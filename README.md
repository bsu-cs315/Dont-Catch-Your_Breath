## Project Report

### Reflection
I put the bare minimum of time into this iteration for requirements and got preoccupied on the hook once again. Despite this, I've made solid progress by the end. My grapple is now almost perfect for my purposes and now hardly ever causes bugs if any. Much of my issue with the grappling hook this time was actually due to several problems occuring at once. I was attempting to change around my code and switched hardware at the same time. I found solutions in changing my hardware to a better mouse, tweaking variables in the editor, and fixing my code. The character can now jump and fire at the same time, and has clearer and more consistent hit detection with the enemies. I also spent too much time on assets this iteration that wern't required, and didn't even end up including most of them. The main thing I learned from this iteration was to truly plan for the unplannable. Development has to start early in case there are convolutions that require extra time to work out. I believe I have a good starting point for future iterations, and I see less potential spots for error. I also learned a lot about camera boundaries and viewports in this iteration. Unfortunately, most of this conflicted with my code in some way as my grappling hook mechanic is based off the viewport. This is something I would like to fix but I don't believe I will spend more time working on the grapple for this project. I also of course plan to limit my scope signifigantly to less assets and less levels.

- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file, and you have satisfied all license requirements.
- [x] C-4: Either the <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game.
- [x] C-5: The release demonstrates the core gameplay loop: the player can take actions that move them toward a goal.
